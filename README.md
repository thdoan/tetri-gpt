# TetriGPT

This is a Tetris® game coded by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (2022 Dec 15 version). For the most part, the code is verbatim what ChatGPT spat out apart from a few minor fixes here and there (see the recording below). For this project, I will take the code ChatGPT produced and build it out into full-blown multi-player game. Anyone is free to contribute.
